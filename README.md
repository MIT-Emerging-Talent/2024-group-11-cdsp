## Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

Domain modeling in our Zero Waste project involves creating a simplified, yet comprehensive representation of the key aspects related to waste management. Think of it as a way to visually capture the essential elements and relationships within the system we're addressing. In our case, this includes understanding how various factors such as economic indicators, cultural differences, and geographical aspects influence waste generation and management practices.

Imagine it as a map that helps us navigate the complexities of waste reduction strategies. We identify the major landmarks, like economic development and cultural norms, and map out the connections between them. This visual guide aids us in developing a clear understanding of how these elements interact and impact our overall goal of achieving Zero Waste.

By having this non-technical model, we're better equipped to communicate insights, spot potential challenges, and guide our decision-making process. It's like having a simplified blueprint that allows us to see the bigger picture and make informed choices on the most effective strategies to reduce waste and promote sustainability.

## Data Set Documentation

# [Milestone 3: Data Analysis](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/2024-group-11-cdsp/tree/main/milestone/milestone_3)

### **Date: 5-16 February, 2024**

## Overview:

![alt text](/extras/1-1-1180x617.png)
The project is based on the analysis of the relationship between economic indicators and waste generation using a dataset extracted from the [2021 UNEP Food Waste Index Report](/extras/FWD%20(1).xlsx).

## `Non-technical explanation of our findings`


In our exploration of the relationship between economic indicators and global waste generation patterns, we've uncovered several noteworthy insights. Our dataset, encompassing diverse countries, allowed us to observe trends and variations in economic factors and waste production.

## Key Findings:

### 1. Working Hours and Wages:

- On average, countries maintain a standard working week of around 38.2 hours, with variations.

- Monthly minimum wages exhibit substantial diversity, ranging from 170 to 3298.4 USD.

### 2. Financial Indicators:

- Lending rates vary widely, averaging at 6.03%, reflecting the financial diversity among nations.

- GDP per capita averages at 57.90 thousand USD, showcasing economic differences.

### 3. Human Development Index (HDI):

- The HDI indicates a high level of development across the considered countries, with an average of 0.894.

## `Levels of Certainty`

While we express moderate to high confidence in our findings, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexities and potential uncertainties associated with our analysis. The following factors contribute to our level of certainty:

- Data Limitations: Our findings rely on the available dataset, and any limitations or gaps in the data may influence the accuracy of our conclusions.

- Assumptions: We made certain assumptions during our analysis, and any deviations from these assumptions could introduce uncertainties in our findings.

- Sampling Variability: If the analysis involved sampling, there may be inherent variability. Our observations represent patterns in the sample, and variations could exist in a broader population.



## Technical description of analysis

This section presents the results of the data analysis conducted using Jupyter Notebook -
[**Analysis**](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/2024-group-11-cdsp/blob/main/milestone/milestone_3/total_analysis.ipynb)

## `Analysis Techniques Used`

| Technique | Objective | Rationale |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| `Data Cleaning` | Handled missing values and normalized column names for uniformity. | Clean data is essential for accurate analysis, and normalization facilitates consistent comparisons. |
| `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)` | Utilized histograms to understand data distribution. | Histograms provide a visual overview of the data, aiding in identifying patterns and potential outliers. |
| `Correlation Analysis` | Explored correlations between economic indicators and waste generation. | Understanding correlations helps identify potential relationships and guide further analysis. |
| `Regression Analysis` | Conducted regression analysis for predicting waste generation levels. | Regression allows for the exploration of relationships between independent and dependent variables, aiding in prediction. |
| `Geospatial Analysis` | Visualized waste distribution across regions using geospatial maps. | Geospatial analysis provides a spatial context to waste generation patterns, offering a comprehensive view. |



## `Possible Flaws in Analysis`

### 1. Data Limitations:

- Explanation: The accuracy of our findings is contingent on the quality and completeness of the dataset. Missing values or incomplete information may impact the robustness of our conclusions.

### 2. Assumptions:

- Explanation: Certain assumptions were made during regression analysis. Deviations from these assumptions, such as the independence of variables, could introduce errors.

### 3. Multicollinearity:

- Explanation: The large condition number in the regression analysis suggests potential issues with multicollinearity, where independent variables are correlated. This can affect the stability and interpretability of coefficients.




## `Possible Alternative Approaches`

### 1. Machine Learning Models:

- Explanation: Instead of traditional regression, machine learning models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting could be explored for predictive modeling, potentially capturing non-linear relationships.

### 2. Robust Regression:

- Explanation: To address potential outliers impacting regression results, robust regression techniques like Huber regression could be considered.

### 3. Advanced Geospatial Techniques:

- Explanation: Utilizing more advanced geospatial analysis techniques, such as spatial autocorrelation, could provide deeper insights into regional waste distribution patterns.


### Applying the Results:

The findings can be used for further research and development of waste management strategies in the context of economic development.
