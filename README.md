## Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

Domain modeling in our Zero Waste project involves creating a simplified, yet comprehensive representation of the key aspects related to waste management. Think of it as a way to visually capture the essential elements and relationships within the system we're addressing. In our case, this includes understanding how various factors such as economic indicators, cultural differences, and geographical aspects influence waste generation and management practices.

Imagine it as a map that helps us navigate the complexities of waste reduction strategies. We identify the major landmarks, like economic development and cultural norms, and map out the connections between them. This visual guide aids us in developing a clear understanding of how these elements interact and impact our overall goal of achieving Zero Waste.

By having this non-technical model, we're better equipped to communicate insights, spot potential challenges, and guide our decision-making process. It's like having a simplified blueprint that allows us to see the bigger picture and make informed choices on the most effective strategies to reduce waste and promote sustainability.

## `Levels of Certainty`

While we express moderate to high confidence in our findings, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexities and potential uncertainties associated with our analysis. The following factors contribute to our level of certainty:

- Data Limitations: Our findings rely on the available dataset, and any limitations or gaps in the data may influence the accuracy of our conclusions.

- Assumptions: We made certain assumptions during our analysis, and any deviations from these assumptions could introduce uncertainties in our findings.

- Sampling Variability: If the analysis involved sampling, there may be inherent variability. Our observations represent patterns in the sample, and variations could exist in a broader population.

## Technical description of analysis

This section presents the results of the data analysis conducted using Jupyter Notebook -
[**Analysis**](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/2024-group-11-cdsp/blob/main/milestone/milestone_3/total_analysis.ipynb)

| Technique                         | Objective                                                                   | Rationale                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Data Cleaning`                   | Handled missing values and normalized column names for uniformity.          | Clean data is essential for accurate analysis, and normalization facilitates consistent comparisons.                                    |
| `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)` | Utilized histograms to understand data distribution.                        | Histograms provide a visual overview of the data, aiding in identifying patterns and potential outliers.                                |
| `Correlation Analysis`            | Explored correlations between economic indicators and waste generation.     | Understanding correlations helps identify potential relationships and guide further analysis.                                           |
| `Regression Analysis`             | Conducted regression analysis for predicting waste generation levels.       | Regression allows for the exploration of relationships between independent and dependent variables, aiding in prediction.               |
| `Geospatial Analysis`             | Visualized waste distribution across regions using geospatial maps.         | Geospatial analysis provides a spatial context to waste generation patterns, offering a comprehensive view.                             |
| `Machine Learning Prediction`     | Used linear regression to predict waste generation levels for future years. | Machine learning models offer a quantitative approach to predict trends and patterns in data, contributing to informed decision-making. |

## `Possible Flaws in Analysis`

### 1. Data Limitations:

- Explanation: The accuracy of our findings is contingent on the quality and completeness of the dataset. Missing values or incomplete information may impact the robustness of our conclusions.

### 2. Assumptions:

- Explanation: Certain assumptions were made during regression analysis. Deviations from these assumptions, such as the independence of variables, could introduce errors.

### 3. Multicollinearity:

- Explanation: The large condition number in the regression analysis suggests potential issues with multicollinearity, where independent variables are correlated. This can affect the stability and interpretability of coefficients.

## `Possible Alternative Approaches`

### 1. Machine Learning Models:

- Explanation: Instead of traditional regression, machine learning models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting could be explored for predictive modeling, potentially capturing non-linear relationships.

### 2. Robust Regression:

- Explanation: To address potential outliers impacting regression results, robust regression techniques like Huber regression could be considered.

### 3. Advanced Geospatial Techniques:

- Explanation: Utilizing more advanced geospatial analysis techniques, such as spatial autocorrelation, could provide deeper insights into regional waste distribution patterns.

### Applying the Results:

The findings can be used for further research and development of waste management strategies in the context of economic development.

# Milestone 4: Communicating Results

### **Date: 19 February - 2 March, 2024**

## Milestone overview: 

## Selecting the Target Audience:

Our target audience is Nonprofit Organizations that specialize in addressing social and environmental issues, including food waste. We are looking to engage organizations that have the greatest potential to influence the groups that waste food the most, such as households, food service and retail.

## Measures that Nonprofit Organizations can take to influence the reduction of food waste:

- Promoting conscious consumption: Organizations can conduct information campaigns and educational activities for consumers on healthy eating, responsible food handling and minimizing wastage.
- Supporting restaurants and catering establishments: Organizations can promote the implementation of programs for the storage and use of leftovers in restaurants and other food service establishments.
- Developing food recycling programs: Nonprofit organizations can promote the development of food recycling programs at food service locations. Be proactive in increasing the number of garbage cans in cities and providing them with biodegradable bags to encourage separate waste sorting and recycling.
- Establish partnerships with grocery stores and food suppliers: Organizations can partner with grocery stores and food providers to reduce food rejection and wastage.
- Support local initiatives to distribute free food: Organizations can organize programs to collect and distribute leftover food to local social service agencies or individuals in need.
- Develop technology to track and manage leftover food: Nonprofits can develop or support the development of technologies to help track and manage leftover food at various points in the supply chain.
- Political and public lobbying: Organizations can engage in lobbying for legislative changes or the development of community initiatives to reduce food waste.
- Monitoring and evaluation: Monitoring and evaluating the level of food waste in their sectors and jointly developing strategies to reduce it.
- Sponsoring educational programs: Supporting educational programs aimed at raising awareness of food waste.

## Limitations we may face:

-  Financial Limitations: Non-profit organizations may have limited financial resources to participate in projects.
-  Resource constraints: Some organizations may have limited resources to actively participate in projects.
-  Partnership Opportunities: Nonprofit organizations can find new opportunities to collaborate and develop their activities.

## Ways to Achieve Cooperation:

Direct Appeal: We will approach non-profit organizations directly, offering cooperation and sharing resources to achieve a common goal.
Partnerships: Establishing partnerships with organizations, including sharing knowledge, resources and expertise.
Organizing Events: Holding joint events, workshops and trainings with non-profit organizations to raise awareness and collaboration in       reducing food waste. 

## The final decision
How we will present to them: a poster or a Power Point presentation (to be decided after Monday's workshop).
