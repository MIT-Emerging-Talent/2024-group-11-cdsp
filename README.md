# Zero Waste Initiative


## Overview

Zero Waste offers a systematic approach to avoiding or reusing waste with the aim of minimizing its disposal into landfills. It's a strategic resource management paradigm that is becoming increasingly relevant in today's world, where the need for sustainable development and efficient resource utilization is evident.

# [Collaborative Development]() 

## Core Issues

- **Technological Innovations:** What new technologies can be utilized for waste collection, sorting, and processing to achieve zero waste?
- **Educational Programs:** How can public awareness regarding the importance of Zero Waste programs be raised and encourage the adoption of new eco-friendly habits?
- **Waste Management in Cities:** What urban management strategies can facilitate the successful implementation of Zero Waste programs in large cities?


## Methodology

- **Understanding People:** Gather insights from personal experiences and data obtained from open sources to analyze stakeholders' perspectives on waste management.
- **Defining the Issue:** Analyze statements from various stakeholder groups to identify key challenges and opportunities in waste management.
- **Generating Ideas and Making Progress:** Engage in collaborative brainstorming sessions to devise innovative solutions. Test these ideas through simulations or small-scale projects, continuously iterating based on feedback and data analysis.

### Actionable Research Questions:
Throughout the project, we refined our research questions for greater specificity:

1. What is the average per capita household food waste in the studied region, and how does it vary across different income brackets or urban and rural areas?
2. What is the collective economic impact of food waste on a global scale, and how does it affect different regions economically?
3. Are there correlations between the economic prosperity of a region and its success in implementing effective food waste reduction initiatives?


## 🌱 Problem Identification, Domain Understanding, and Statement
Our project addresses challenges in implementing Zero Waste programs, with a particular focus on cultural and geographical factors hindering the adoption of new consumption practices and waste management strategies within the food industry.

Our team works with global data and analysis, with a focus on countries where team members currently reside.


# [Data Collection](./milestone/milestone_2) 

**_Be aware that the full description of this milestone you can find by refer to [README](./milestone/milestone_2/README.md)_**

## Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

Domain modeling in our Zero Waste project involves creating a simplified representation of key aspects related to waste management. It's a visual guide, akin to a map, helping us understand how economic indicators, cultural differences, and geography influence waste generation and management practices.

This non-technical model serves as a blueprint, aiding communication, identifying challenges, and guiding decision-making for effective waste reduction strategies.



## Data Collection and Cleaning Scripts

For transparency and replication, we provide all scripts for data collection and cleaning, covering the entire process, including data partitioning.

## Our Research Work

Engaged in Data Science research, our team focuses on implementing zero waste programs, leveraging practical experience and modern data analysis methods to contribute significantly to the field.

# [Data Analysis](./milestone/milestone_3) 
**_Be aware that the full description of this milestone you can find by refer to [README](./milestone/milestone_3/README.md)_**

![alt text](/extras/1-1-1180x617.png)
The project analyzes the relationship between economic indicators and waste generation using data from the [2021 UNEP Food Waste Index Report](</extras/FWD%20(1).xlsx>).

## `Non-technical explanation of our findings`

Our exploration of the relationship between economic indicators and global waste generation patterns yielded several insights. The dataset, covering diverse countries, allowed us to observe trends and variations in economic factors and waste production.

## `Key Findings`

The overall model does not explain a significant proportion of the variance in the total waste estimate (R-squared = 0.156). Additionally, individual economic indicators do not exhibit strong statistical significance in predicting the total waste production.



## `Technical description of analysis`

Results of the data analysis conducted using Jupyter Notebook can be found [**here**](/milestone/milestone_3/total_analysis.ipynb).

## `Technical explanation of our findings`


1. **Household Food Waste Across Regions:**
   - Poland and the USA exhibit similar per capita household food waste.
   - Canada and Denmark show higher estimates, indicating advanced waste management systems.

2. **Global Economic Impact of Food Waste:**
   - Global average food waste volume is around 3.17 million tonnes.
   - Higher development level countries like the USA have larger volumes of food waste.

3. **Relationship Between Economic Prosperity and Food Waste Reduction Initiatives:**
   - Sensitivity to economic indicators suggests regions with higher economic development may have more resources for waste reduction initiatives.
   - Supplementary research is recommended for a comprehensive understanding.
