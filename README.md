# Zero Waste Initiative

## Overview

Zero Waste offers a systematic approach to avoiding or reusing waste with the aim of minimizing its disposal into landfills. It's a strategic resource management paradigm that is becoming increasingly relevant in today's world, where the need for sustainable development and efficient resource utilization is evident.

## Overview:

**_Be aware that the full description of this milestone you can find by refer to [README](./milestone/milestone_1/README.md)_**

### Actionable Research Questions:

Throughout the project, we refined our research questions for greater specificity:

1. What is the average per capita household food waste in the studied region, and how does it vary across different income brackets or urban and rural areas?
2. What is the collective economic impact of food waste on a global scale, and how does it affect different regions economically?
3. Are there correlations between the economic prosperity of a region and its success in implementing effective food waste reduction initiatives?

## ðŸŒ± Problem Identification, Domain Understanding, and Statement

Our project addresses challenges in implementing Zero Waste programs, with a particular focus on cultural and geographical factors hindering the adoption of new consumption practices and waste management strategies within the food industry.

## Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

Domain modeling in our Zero Waste project involves creating a simplified representation of key aspects related to waste management. It's a visual guide, akin to a map, helping us understand how economic indicators, cultural differences, and geography influence waste generation and management practices.

This non-technical model serves as a blueprint, aiding communication, identifying challenges, and guiding decision-making for effective waste reduction strategies.

## Data Collection and Cleaning Scripts

For transparency and replication, we provide all scripts for data collection and cleaning, covering the entire process, including data partitioning.

## Our Research Work

Engaged in Data Science research, our team focuses on implementing zero waste programs, leveraging practical experience and modern data analysis methods to contribute significantly to the field.

The project analyzes the relationship between economic indicators and waste generation using data from the [2021 UNEP Food Waste Index Report](</extras/FWD%20(1).xlsx>).

## `Non-technical explanation of our findings`

Our exploration of the relationship between economic indicators and global waste generation patterns yielded several insights. The dataset, covering diverse countries, allowed us to observe trends and variations in economic factors and waste production.

## Key Findings:

The overall model does not explain a significant proportion of the variance in the total waste estimate (R-squared = 0.156). Additionally, individual economic indicators do not exhibit strong statistical significance in predicting the total waste production.

1. **Household Food Waste Across Regions:**

   - Poland and the USA exhibit similar per capita household food waste.
   - Canada and Denmark show higher estimates, indicating advanced waste management systems.

2. **Global Economic Impact of Food Waste:**

   - Global average food waste volume is around 3.17 million tonnes.
   - Higher development level countries like the USA have larger volumes of food waste.

3. **Relationship Between Economic Prosperity and Food Waste Reduction Initiatives:**
   - Sensitivity to economic indicators suggests regions with higher economic development may have more resources for waste reduction initiatives.
   - Supplementary research is recommended for a comprehensive understanding.

## `Technical description of analysis`

Results of the data analysis conducted using Jupyter Notebook can be found [**here**](/milestone/milestone_3/total_analysis.ipynb).

### Applying the Results:

The findings can be used for further research and development of waste management strategies in the context of economic development.

## Selecting the Target Audience:

Our focus is on Nonprofit Organizations dedicated to addressing social and environmental issues, specifically in the realm of food waste. We aim to engage organizations with significant influence on groups contributing to food waste, such as households, food service, and retail.

## Key Strategies for Nonprofit Organizations to Reduce Food Waste:

Nonprofits can reduce food waste significantly by promoting conscious consumption, supporting efficient practices in restaurants, advocating for recycling programs, and collaborating with grocery stores. This comprehensive approach fosters sustainability and responsible food management, positioning nonprofits at the forefront of the fight against food waste.

## Limitations:

Nonprofit organizations often face financial and resource limitations. Insufficient funds can restrict the scale of their projects, while a lack of personnel, technology, or assets affects their overall operations.Exploring new partnership opportunities is another challenging task. The success of such initiatives relies on the ability to communicate effectively and collaborate with other organizations.Effectively managing resources, seeking innovative solutions, and consistently analyzing partnership opportunities are key to overcoming limitations and enhancing the impact of nonprofit organizations.

## Cooperation Strategies:

Cooperation strategies include direct appeals to nonprofit organizations for collaboration and resource sharing, establishing partnerships with other entities to exchange knowledge and resources, and organizing joint events, workshops, and training sessions to raise awareness and foster collaboration in reducing food waste. These approaches aim to strengthen collective efforts and contribute to more sustainable outcomes.
