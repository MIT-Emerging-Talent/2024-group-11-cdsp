**Participants: [Anna Shliapkina](https://github.com/AnnaShliapkina), [Dmytro Lytvynenko](https://github.com/DmytroLyt), [Yanina Chukanova](https://github.com/YaninaChukanova)**

## Stop Doing

- Overlooking Visualization Clarity:

  - Stop overlooking the importance of clear visualizations in the non-technical explanation; strive for improved clarity in conveying findings.

- Limited Exploration of Alternative Analyses:

  - Stop limiting exploration of alternative analysis approaches; commit to a more comprehensive exploration to enrich understanding.

## Continue Doing

- Balancing Complexity in Analysis:

  - Continue the approach of balancing the complexity of analysis techniques with simplicity, ensuring alignment with project questions and constraints.

- Effective Communication of Uncertainty:

  - Continue the effective communication of sources of uncertainty in the data analysis, maintaining transparency in presenting results.

## Start Doing

- Enhanced Visualization Review:

  - Start a comprehensive review of visualizations in the non-technical explanation to enhance clarity and accessibility for a broader audience.

- Exploration of Additional Analysis Approaches:

  - Start actively exploring additional alternative analysis approaches to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Lessons Learned

- Balancing Complexity:

  - Learned the importance of balancing the complexity of analysis techniques with simplicity to effectively answer project questions.

- Communication of Certainty Levels:

  - Realized the significance of clearly communicating levels of certainty in findings, considering the inherent uncertainty in data analysis.

- Flexibility in Approaches:

  - Recognized the value of being flexible in choosing analysis approaches, adapting them to the unique characteristics of the data and project requirements.

## Strategy vs. Board



### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Appropriate Analysis Techniques:

  - The plan to use appropriate analysis techniques matching the project questions, domain, and data constraints went as expected, yielding meaningful insights.

- Understanding Data Limitations:

  - The plan to understand the limitations of data analysis and formulate questions effectively aligned with the expected outcomes.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Visualization Clarity Oversight:

  - The initial plan did not give sufficient emphasis on visualization clarity, leading to the need for improvement.

- Limited Exploration of Alternative Analyses:

  - The plan did not sufficiently emphasize the exploration of alternative analysis approaches, requiring adjustment for future analysis phases.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Enhanced Visualization Review Steps:

  - Additional steps for enhanced visualization review were added to improve clarity in conveying findings.

- Active Exploration of Additional Analyses:

  - The need for actively exploring additional analysis approaches became evident, leading to their inclusion in the ongoing strategy.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Simplified Documentation Process:

  - Streamlined the documentation process by focusing on key information and removing unnecessary details, improving readability.

- Focused Error Source Identification:

  - Focused error source identification by removing redundant steps, making the process more efficient.
