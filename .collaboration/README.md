# Collaborative Development

## Core Issues

- **Technological Innovations:** What new technologies can be utilized for waste collection, sorting, and processing to achieve zero waste?
- **Educational Programs:** How can public awareness regarding the importance of Zero Waste programs be raised and encourage the adoption of new eco-friendly habits?
- **Waste Management in Cities:** What urban management strategies can facilitate the successful implementation of Zero Waste programs in large cities?

## Generating Ideas and Making Progress

Brainstorm new and creative solutions to reduce waste and promote zero waste initiatives. Test these ideas through simulations or small-scale projects to evaluate effectiveness. Continuously iterate and refine solutions based on feedback from participants and data analysis. Ensure that all solutions are user-friendly, culturally appropriate, and considerate of all stakeholders' perspectives.

## Methodology

- **Understanding People:** Gather insights from personal experiences and data obtained from open sources to analyze stakeholders' perspectives on waste management.
- **Defining the Issue:** Analyze statements from various stakeholder groups to identify key challenges and opportunities in waste management.
- **Generating Ideas and Making Progress:** Engage in collaborative brainstorming sessions to devise innovative solutions. Test these ideas through simulations or small-scale projects, continuously iterating based on feedback and data analysis.

## Algorithms and Data Structures: Group Study
